# Setup Wizard

Post install setup script that can be used to perform maintenance after a VM is cloned, install useful packages, and install Docker with Portainer (both full and agent).

To run the script, either copy the raw code into a new file and make it executable (sudo chmod +rwx ./setupWizard.sh), or clone this repository and run the command that way.

(More thorough readme coming soon)
